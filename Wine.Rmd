## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
WhiteWine <- read.csv('winequality-white.csv', sep=';')
names(WhiteWine)
```


```{r}
install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)

names(WhiteWine)
ggplot(aes(x=sulphates), data = WhiteWine) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = .01) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:1.5)
```
